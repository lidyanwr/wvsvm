	I roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright,
	Fifteen hundred of the emperor's largest horses were employed to draw me,
	I made a countenance as if I would eat him alive,
	The emperor desired I would stand like a colossus,
	I walked with the utmost circumspection to avoid treading on any stragglers,
	The enemy discharged several thousand arrows,
	Three hundred tailors were employed to make me clothes,
	He desired I would hear him with patience,
	I set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich,
	He brought me within three yards of his eyes,
	The horrible animals had the boldness to attack me,
	I took up a thimble filled with liquor and drank their health,
	Three great scholars examined my shape,
	I dispatched four of them with my hanger,
	One of them hit me on the back and knocked me down,
	The ladies gave me a gale with their fans,
	Banging the proper keys with my two sticks,
	From thence was taken into the ship,
	I could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down,
