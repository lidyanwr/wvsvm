 proposeth his manner of living for the future
 gives good advice

i roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright
fifteen hundred of the emperor's largest horses were employed to draw me
i made a countenance as if i would eat him alive
the emperor desired i would stand like a colossus
i walked with the utmost circumspection to avoid treading on any stragglers
the enemy discharged several thousand arrows
three hundred tailors were employed to make me clothes
he desired i would hear him with patience
i set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at greenwich
he brought me within three yards of his eyes
the horrible animals had the boldness to attack me
i took up a thimble filled with liquor and drank their health
three great scholars examined my shape
i dispatched four of them with my hanger
one of them hit me on the back and knocked me down
the ladies gave me a gale with their fans
banging the proper keys with my two sticks
from thence was taken into the ship
i could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down
he was deep in a problem
the greatest curiosity is a loadstone of a prodigious size
he called aloud to me not to disturb his web
let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each other
the governor gave the sign for caesar and brutus to advance
they were the most mortifying sight i ever beheld
a herd of forty came flocking about me
it cost me much trouble to explain what i was doing
they were used to all kinds of drudgery
a third would take advantage and carry it away
the servants drive a herd of yahoos into the field laden with hay
i fell to imitate their gait and gesture
four of them searched every cranny till they found me

 and concludeth
i roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright
fifteen hundred of the emperor's largest horses were employed to draw me
i made a countenance as if i would eat him alive
the emperor desired i would stand like a colossus
i walked with the utmost circumspection to avoid treading on any stragglers
the enemy discharged several thousand arrows
three hundred tailors were employed to make me clothes
he desired i would hear him with patience
i set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at greenwich
he brought me within three yards of his eyes
the horrible animals had the boldness to attack me
i took up a thimble filled with liquor and drank their health
three great scholars examined my shape
i dispatched four of them with my hanger
one of them hit me on the back and knocked me down
the ladies gave me a gale with their fans
banging the proper keys with my two sticks
from thence was taken into the ship
i could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down
he was deep in a problem
the greatest curiosity is a loadstone of a prodigious size
he called aloud to me not to disturb his web
let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each other
the governor gave the sign for caesar and brutus to advance
they were the most mortifying sight i ever beheld
a herd of forty came flocking about me
it cost me much trouble to explain what i was doing
they were used to all kinds of drudgery
a third would take advantage and carry it away
the servants drive a herd of yahoos into the field laden with hay
i fell to imitate their gait and gesture
four of them searched every cranny till they found me
